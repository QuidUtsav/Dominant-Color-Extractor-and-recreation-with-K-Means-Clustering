# Dominant-Color-Extractor-and-recreation-with-K-Means-Clustering
Extracts dominant colors from any image using K-Means clustering (SciPy) and visualizes results with color quantization.

Features:
- Loads and processes RGB pixels from JPEG/PNG images
- Applies K-Means to find dominant colors
- Displays original vs quantized (posterized) image side-by-side
- Shows top dominant color swatches

Built as a learning project during unsupervised learning studies. Fully local — no external APIs needed.

Perfect for understanding clustering on real-world data like images!
